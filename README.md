Teamfight Tactics Decisive Support System  

This is my current project, and I will work on advices which champion should user pick from 5 random champions that user can buy.  

I will use my knowledge to build fuzzy logic system that will calculate uncertain utility for every single champion and their combinations as a team.  I dont recommend using it in ranked games especially its wasnt test with game yet.

You can track my progress in projects section.

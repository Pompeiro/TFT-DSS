# TFT-DSS
Teamfight Tactics Decisive Support System  

This is my current project, and I will work on advices which champion should user pick from 5 random champions that user can buy.  

I will use my knowledge to build fuzzy logic system that will calculate uncertain utility for every single champion and their combinations as a team.  I dont recommend using it in ranked games especially its wasnt test with game yet.

You can track my progress in projects section.

Results of first three attempts playing normal game with 54 points in silver 4.
You should pay attention that TFTDSS supported me only in choosing champion to buy. I took care about items and champions placement on the field myself.
